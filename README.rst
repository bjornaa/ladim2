LADiM2 – the Lagrangian Advection and Diffusion Model, version 2
================================================================

This is a new developing version of `LADiM <https://github.com/bjornaa/ladim>`_.

The main difference from the old version is higher flexibility. In particular, it can be
used as a library.

The yaml configuration interface to the ladim script is close to final, but the API is
not fixed yet.
