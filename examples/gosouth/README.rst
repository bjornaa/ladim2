Adding a constant horizontal velocity
=====================================

This example is a modification of the line example
adding a constant velocity in arbitrary direction.

The given setting is 2 cm/s towards south (direction=180)

Requires that the ROMS angle variable is available in the Grid class.

To more clearly see the effect, ramp up the velocity to 0.5 m/s
