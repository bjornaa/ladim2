Stommel model of westwards intensification
==========================================

This example is based on the stationary 2D current field from an analytical ocean model
of wind-driven ocean currents on a beta-plane. The model is derived by Stommel (1948).
The gridforce module uses the same variable names as the Stommel paper.

Due to westwards intensification this current field strongly distorts advected patterns.
It is a tough test for Eulerian advection schemes (Hecht et al. 1995), and has been
suggested as a standard test for Lagrangrian advection (Fabbroni, 2009) and later (Lange
and van Sebille, 2017).

In this directory, there are two versions

stommel.py
  A low-lvel version, imports analytical.py and state.py

stommel2.py
  Higher level, uses custom classes and a LADiM type main function

Both perform the simulation and plot the resulting particle distribution.
