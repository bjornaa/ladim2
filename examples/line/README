Remake of the old ladim line example

Have two versions:

1) line.py
A script that calls the necessary modules with configuration
by arguments in the script.

2) line2.py

A general ladim script, configured by a yaml file.
Presently: only instantaneous particle release at
start of simulation.

Some of the modules are in this directory as they are not
general enough to be part of the main ladim2 package.

Perhaps also a third version, as a jupyter notebook
