Remake of the old ladim line example

Will have two versions:

1) line.py
A script that calls the necessary modules with configuration
in the script.

Presently no output netcdf file.

2) As old ladim example
A configuration file and release file as input to a ladim2 application

Perhaps also a third version, as a jupyter notebook
