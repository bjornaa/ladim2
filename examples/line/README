Line source example
===================

A line of particles is released instantaneously across the North Sea.

This can be run in several ways, with varying degrees of control.

1) ladim

Uses configuration in ladim.yaml and release file line.rls and runs the LADiM
application.

2) python line2.py

A separate python script, using ladim.yaml and line.rls.
This is a slightly modified version of ladim/main.py and can be used as a starting point
for more customization than allowed with the yaml configuration.

3) python line.py

This is a more stand-alone script. It does *not* use ladim.yaml and line.rls.
Instead these functions are handled internally. Uses the API of LADiM2, in particular
the state, grid, timer, force, tracker, and output modules.

4) A jupyter notebook example (not implemented yet)
