Curly vectors example
=====================

This example shows how the LADiM API can be used to provide plot of curly vectors in the
style of NCAR Command Language (NCL). A class Curly is defined in curly.py that produces
horizontal  plots with curly vectors given a ROMS data file, a record number into the
file and the desired depth. The Curly object can be customized by the density argument
(how many grid cells between curly vectors) and the length of the vector by dt and
num_steps. The class tries to produce reasonable default values for these parameters.
Line width and color can be given as arguments to the plot method. The method trajectory
returns the data defining the trajectories. This can be used with other plot systems than
matplotlib or be transformed to different map projections.

Curly vectors can of course be produced more simply without using the LADiM machinery.
The example is included to show the flexibility of the LADiM API.
