Backwards example
=================

This example demonstrates how to do time reversed simulations. The "initial" particle
release is a perturbed version of the particle distribution from the line example after
25 days simulation. The particles are tracked backwards for these 25 days.

With unperturbed release (sigma = 0 in make_release.py) the particles that do not get close
to the coast ends up very close to the original particle position. An interesting
exercise is to see how large perturbations can be used before the backwards tracking no
longer converges to the forward initial line distribution.

make_release.py
  Reads the forward file at record 200, perturbable, and writes a release file.

ladim2 ladim2.yaml
  Backtracks the particles

animate.py
  Animates the reversal of the particle distribution. The purple line shows the initial
  distribution of the forward particles.

To activate backwards simulations in the yaml file, the start time must be later than the
stop time and the time_reversal flag must be set to True.

The line example must be run prior to running the present example.
